SOSAWG backstop mock products - Set 3
8 April 2011
K. Gage, D. Jones

This README contains information about this set of backstop mock products.

They were assembled by running backstop against a set of manually-edited
combined command load files and manually combined "vehicle" and "observing"
timeline report files. The latest prototype version of backstop was run once
against the set of inputs. Note that the backstop files and associated
output can only be as accurate as are the inputs.

The contents of this directory are intended to reflect the approved directory
structure and file naming conventions. There may be load naming inconsistencies
throughout this directory, and these are owed to the way in which the products 
were assembled. If such inconsistencies become problematic in analyzing these 
products, please contact Dave or Ken and we will work to resolve any issue. It 
was decided that naming issues were not central to the process at this time.

The contents here are intended to reflect the state of the directory
immediately after a mission planner has run backstop -- and to this end,
not all customary items are present. Each item from the OCT0410A archive
directory is listed here, along with how it was "simulated"/"assembled" for the
mock products.
